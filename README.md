## Challenge Log:

It took half of my time (almost 8 hours) to figure out how to get json data appropriately which I've never done before. The solution I came up with is probably quite a long and painful method, but it still works to some extent.
It has some issues though. It takes a very long time to process data and show it on the screen simply because there is a huge number of comics. So I had to cut the number.

Comic details activity works fine.

Comic search works fine. This also took some time since I've never used webview before and I am sure there is plenty of room for improvement.

I had no time for comic explanations. Who does? :)

Fav is my favorite part which is also affected by my bad time usage. I think I could have done it with either SQLlite or ROOM.

Sharing data was also a new thing for me to get used to it. I came up with a solution but I'm not very content with it. It could be better.

Getting notification is the trickiest part of this challenge in my opinion. I've done it on my other project 'doyur'. (I did yeah.. What?). But it was hell. So it would take more than 16 hours to make it correctly.

By that, if the client means reading comics on tv or his/her watch, NO!


## Final Comments to Shortcutters:

It was great a experience overall. I had fun learning new ways and not being able to implement them correctly! Thanks for that. It was a cure for my ego :)

And actually, I found the solution on GitHub (https://github.com/fireflyfif/shortcut-android-challenge) in the first place but you know, it wouldn't be nice at all ;) OK maybe some inspiration.. but thats all. I know, "the best programmers write no code" so I could've used it if things were different but this was for fun.

Thank you!
