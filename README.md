Challenge Log:

It took half of my time (almost 8 hours) to figure out how to get json data appropriately which I've never done before. The solution I came up with is probably quite a long and painful method, but it still works to some extent.
It has some issues though. It takes a very long time to process data and show it on the screen simply because there is a huge number of comics. So I had to cut the number.

Comic details activity works fine.

Comic search works fine. This also took some time since I've never used webview before and I am sure there is plenty of room for improvement.

I had no time for comic explanations. Who does? :)

Fav is my favorite part which is also affected by my bad time usage. I think I could have done it with either SQLlite or ROOM.
